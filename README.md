Nowadays there is bad time for cafes, hotels and restaurants in our country. During the last six months of the year, their failure and bankruptcy
increased to about 40%. It is considered that there are two reasons for this decline. Firstly, it is explained by a lack of purchasing power; and secondly
, it is prohibition for smoking in public places.
This prohibition for smoking in public places is not only reason for that decline. Certainly,
a lot of cafes and bars are affected by the crisis mostly. And m
ore than eight hundred have closed in this year. The bars which resist this crisis are trying to attract new customers. 
They attract the oldest people and especially women. Also they organize concerts to attract young people.
After all it is hard to hold their position in this crisis. A lot of customers have less money at this moment
and they donâ€™t want to spend about 10 euro for a meal. Besides, people take less time for eating. In the last century they spent an average of an hour 
at the table, but today they stay there only about 35 minutes. Thus, restaurants, cafes and bars have the only way to get rid of the failure today. 
They will have to adapt by offering cheaper dishes and served more quickly.
